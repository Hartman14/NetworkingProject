//Still working on//

-Objects arent tied to a specific gps location yet, still kinda just overlay on the camera.

-in the future with the AR goggles, will probably have to make the camera transparent since we wouldnt
want a camera image on top of the glasses lense.

-got gyroscope functioning when you run it on an andriod device. Also can still move player around on PC like 
the original example put up. Player can only look around while running it on an andriod device.

-made some basic sprites for a HUD, you guys can change that if you want.
